Design Patterns
==============

This project has examples (in C#) of various design patterns.

These examples are from "Head First Design Patterns" book.

This Visual Studio solution (created in VS 2012) contains an individual project for each design pattern. Apart from an individual 
console project for each design pattern, every pattern also has modelling project which has the class diagram.
